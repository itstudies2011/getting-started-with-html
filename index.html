<b>Understanding how users, computers, servers, HTTP, and the internet work together</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Basics:</b><br>
<br><b>HTML</b> main document type<br>
     <b>URLs</b> how you refer to documents on the web<br>
     <b>HTTP</b> main protocol<br>

<div><p>The web is a collection of documents:  plain text, HTML, images, video, and music.
In a browser users request via the internet, information stored on a server. The server responds with the files displayed on the users browser. 
<b>HTML</b> stands for HyperText Markup Language .  Documents contain text or other information and the markup  is how it is formatted.</p>
Computers interpret what the programmer inputs <b>literally</b> so mistakes can cause <b>major</b> problems.<br>
<b><p>HTML Elements</p></b></div>

<div><p>HTML documents are made up of <b>Elements.</b> Element types are determined by <b>tags.</b> <b>Tags</b> are used to <b><em>markup</em></b> the text in numerous ways.
  <b>Inline elements</b> are simply line by line while <b>Block Elements</b> form aninvisible box around its contents and add height and length.</p>
<b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> are both languages used to  design web pages.  <b>HTML</b> controls the structure of the page and <b>CSS</b> controls the style or format and form of the page.<p></p>  
<b>DOM</b>= Document Object Model.  Crosses language platforms represents and interacts with objects in <B>HTML</B> organized "tree-style"
The ""tree-like structure” means <B>HTML</B> elements can have other elements inside them.   Like boxes within boxes within boxes.</div>
